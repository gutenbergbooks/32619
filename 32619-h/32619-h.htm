<p>ou can't go shooting off
to <i>that</i> dimension for peanuts.
I don't want to give
you the impression that peanuts
are in short supply here, or that
our economy is in the fix of having
to import them sidewise.
What I'm trying to convey is
that, if you're one of the rare
ones functionally equipped to do
the side-shuffle, you ought to be
well paid for it&mdash;in any coin.</p>

<p>That's what I told Krasnow.
And he wasn't after peanuts.
"I'll do it," I said, "if you'll make
it worth my while."</p>

<p>"I'd hardly expect you to do
it for nothing," he replied reproachfully.
"How much do you
want?"</p>

<p>I told him. The amount shook
him up, but only briefly.</p>

<p>"Okay," he said grudgingly. "I
suppose I'll have to give it to you.
But the stuff had better be good."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is," I assured him.
"And you don't have to be afraid,
because I couldn't possibly skip
with the loot. I'll have to travel
naked. I can't get there with so
much as a sandal on one foot or a
filling in a single tooth. Fortunately,
my teeth are perfect."</p>

<p>Sweat poured off Krasnow's
florid face as he worked the combination
of his office safe. His fat
jowls quivered unhappily around
his cigar while he counted out the
bills. Ten per cent was cash in advance,
and the rest went into a
bank account in my name. I paid
off a batch of bills, then stripped
and did my off-to-Buffalo.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/h2.png" alt="H" width="61" height="50" /></div>
<p>onest" John Krasnow was
a crooked District Attorney
who wanted to be Governor and
then President. He had the Machine,
but he didn't have the
People. And, because he needed
the People, he needed me. I had
been to this other dimension&mdash;the
one on the farthest branch of the
time-tree&mdash;and I could give him
what he wanted.</p>

<p>Krasnow found out about it
after I was hauled up in front
of him on a check-kiting charge.
I'd had something of a reputation
before I got into difficulties
and, in trying to live up to the
reputation, I had done some plain
and fancy financing. Nothing that
fifteen to twenty grand wouldn't
have fixed&mdash;but while I scrounged
around, trying to get cash, I
kited a few checks. They pyramided
me right into the D.A.'s
office, where Krasnow was properly
sympathetic.</p>

<p>"How," he asked, "could a man
of your standing in the scientific
world stoop so low?" It developed
into quite a lecture and, even
coming from Krasnow, it made
me feel pretty low.</p>

<p>So I began explaining. I told
him where I was born, and where
I went to school, and where I
had taken my sabbaticals&mdash;including
this other dimension.
And Krasnow believed me. I
can't account for it, except possibly
because he knew he was a
crook and knew I wasn't one&mdash;exactly.
Anyway, he believed me,
and we made the deal and I did
the side-shuffle, as agreed.</p>

<p>The journey to that other dimension
is not a pleasant one.
It does disturbing things to the
stomach, and you see everything
thin and elongated, as if you're
sitting too far to the side in a
movie theater.</p>

<p>I got there, however, and waited
for the hiccups to subside.
<i>Hiccupi laterali</i>, I had called
them when I considered writing
an article for the <i>Medical Journal</i>
after my first trip. With the hiccupi
gone, I stole some clothing&mdash;which
was one of the riskiest parts
of the program&mdash;and waited for
morning. I didn't have any
money, of course, so I had to
hitchhike into town.</p>

<p>I could have stolen myself a
better fit, but people aren't
clothes-conscious in that dimension.
They're more interested in
what you are and what you can
do. The driver of the car that
gave me a lift asked, "And what
is your field of endeavor?"</p>

<p>I told him, "I am able to eliminate
the long wait in ivory production
by accelerating the
growth cycle of elephants."</p>

<p>He was deeply impressed and
tipped me handsomely. I was less
impressed with his talent for
growing cobless corn, and therefore
had to return only a small
part of the sum he gave me.</p>

<p>The world of this dimension
had developed some remarkable
parallels to Earth. I mean our
Earth, which falls into what I
have designated Timeline One
Point One, since it's the Earth
with which I am most familiar.
Every other world that has a language
calls itself Earth, too. I
had to visit briefly hundreds
of the lateral worlds, hovering
over primordial swamps, limitless
oceans, insect kingdoms and radioactive
planetoids, before I
found the one that was truly
parallel.</p>

<p>It existed in Timeline Seventeen
Point Zero Eight, and it had
refrigerators, platinum blondes,
automobiles, airplanes, apple pie,
tabloids, television, scotch and
soda&mdash;just about everything we
think makes life worthwhile. But
it had its little differences, which
was only to be expected in a
timeline where the bionomics
could create a new world each
time someone changed his mind.</p>

<p>Thus, the cobless-corn man was
driving what looked to me like
a Chevrolet, but which was a
Morton in his world. He let me
off near a downtown restaurant
where, thanks to our little exchange
of talent talk, I had
enough money for breakfast. It
was considered unethical to swap
talent talk outside the limits of
certain rigidly defined groups, so
I didn't try to out-impress the
waitress.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/f3.png" alt="F" width="38" height="50" /></div>
<p>ed, and filling my stolen
clothes a bit better, I walked
to the recorder's office and spent
the rest of the morning looking
up old documents. There was
nothing there for Krasnow, as I
had expected. But for me there
was a very pretty file clerk.
Talking to her, I verified my impression
that human instincts and
relationships were much the same
in this dimension as in my own&mdash;except
in the one basic respect
that interested Krasnow, of
course.</p>

<p>The file clerk and I lunched together
and then I spent the afternoon
in the library. But I didn't
find anything there, either, and
then I had dinner with her. She
said her name was Julie. I told
her mine was Heck, for Hector,
which it is. She thought this was
"awfully cute" and we got along
fine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image_1.png" width="400" height="470" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Julie had a delightful apartment
and a matching sense of
hospitality. The following day,
when she went to work, I stayed
home and washed the dishes and
made the bed and used the telephone.</p>

<p>I ran up quite a bill with my
long-distance calls, but I found
out what I needed to know. I
impressed a lot of people with my
elephant story and pretended to
be impressed hardly at all with
what they told me they did&mdash;although
often I was, very much.</p>

<p>The trouble with these people
is that they no longer know how
to lie, if that can be listed as
trouble. I don't think it can.
Neither did Krasnow, obviously.
He'd never have sent me off on
my expensive side-trip if he had.</p>

<p>Of course, Krasnow looked at
it objectively. What he wanted
from Timeline Seventeen Point
Zero Eight was not for himself.
It was for everybody else. He
wanted the formula for the truth
gas these people had developed
long ago and loosed upon their
world to put a stop to wars.</p>

<p>They had been in a bad way,
although no worse than the sort
of problem we were up against.
Their trans-ocean squabbles and
power politics seemed to have
settled into a pattern of a war
or two per generation. Just like
us. Hence, the man who invented the truth gas became a
global hero, after a certain
amount of cynicism and skepticism.
All the doubts vanished,
naturally, once the gas got to
working. And so did war.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image_2.png" width="600" height="540" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>You can't do much plotting and
scheming if, every time you open
your mouth to tell a lie, you
stammer, sweat, turn red and
gasp for breath. It's a dead giveaway.
Nobody tries it more than
once.</p>

<p>One or two men had tried to
nullify the gas or work out a
local antidote, either as a pure
research project or through
power-madness.  But, because
they had had to state their purposes
as soon as they thought of
them, they were put away. Neat.
Very neat.</p>

<p>What I wanted was the formula
for the truth gas. Its location
wasn't exactly a secret in this
land of complete candor, but it
wasn't writ large on any wall
for all to see, either. They kept
it in their capital&mdash;located about
where our Omaha is&mdash;on file
among the Vital Statistics.</p>

<p>I took a superjet out there.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i6.png" alt="I" width="38" height="50" /></div>
<p> had no trouble posing as a
historian entitled to the facts.
The gas didn't work on me, you
see, because it was adjusted to the
physiology of that timeline.
There was just enough difference
between us for it not to make me
stick to the truth.</p>

<p>"We'll write out the formula
for you," I was told obligingly.
"But you'll have to sign the
usual statement."</p>

<p>"Of course," I said. "Which one
is that?"</p>

<p>"The one that says you won't
publish it, and will destroy your
copy when it has served your
research purpose, without letting
anyone else see it."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> statement," I said.</p>

<p>I signed freely, told my elephant
story and departed in an
aura of good will.</p>

<p>The jet got me back that same
evening. Julie fixed me up a
snack, and we discussed how
pretty she was and how nice I
was.</p>

<p>I had everything Krasnow
wanted now. I felt pretty good
about it, because there was nobody
else who could have done
the job for him, and because it
wasn't spying, really. Earth One
Point One on the Timeline is
world enough for Krasnow, I'm
sure. Besides, dimensions don't
have wars with one another. Too
many things can go wrong.</p>

<p>Julie was lovely and I hated to
leave the next morning, but it
was my job. I told her, "I'm
afraid I have to leave town for a
bit, dear, but I'll be back very
soon. Business, you know."</p>

<p>Being a Seventeen Point Zero
Eight girl, Julie had no reason
to doubt me. "Make it <i>very</i> soon,"
she whispered, her lips close to
my ear.</p>

<p>So I came back, and now Krasnow
has what he wants. He's delighted,
as he should be. I've
made up the gas for him and adjusted
the formula so that it will
work on people of our timeline.
It's high-power stuff and a little
will go a long way. I also made
up an antidote for him. This was
easy, since I could work on it
without feeling any compulsion
to tell everybody what I was
doing and why.</p>

<p>Krasnow plans to release the
truth gas just before the state
convention. He'll be nominated,
of course, and after November
he'll be Governor. With everyone
else compelled to tell the truth,
it should be a cinch for him. He's
a patient man, Honest John
Krasnow is, and he's willing to
wait four years for the Presidency.</p>

<p>I ought to be happy too. With
the money Krasnow gave me,
I've been living in the style to
which I've always wanted to be
accustomed. He has offered me a
place on his staff and, somewhat
superfluously, the use of his antidote.
Naturally, the reason he
was so magnanimous was that he
doesn't want anyone else around
who knows his gimmick and
might have to tell the truth about
it.</p>

<p>But I have had enough of this
dimension now&mdash;now that Krasnow
has what I promised him.
He's going to use it tomorrow.
And if I know Honest John&mdash;and
I do&mdash;not even the Presidency will
be big enough for him.</p>

<p>So I'm going back to Julie.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/t7.png" alt="T" width="42" height="50" /></div>
<p>here are some obvious questions
in your mind, I know,
such as: Why did I get the formula
for Krasnow, knowing there
was no way for him to prosecute
me while I was in Julie's dimension?
And what made me come
back?</p>

<p>In short&mdash;what was in it for
me?</p>

<p>Let's call it research. Krasnow
is a big-time operator; I've always
been, you might say, in the
peanut end of the game. He had
a great deal to teach me and I,
I'm happy to say, was an apt
pupil. You might speculate on
what's in it for you, because, if
you ask me, anybody who can
do the side-shuffle should do it
before Krasnow becomes President.</p>

<p>However, don't go to Seventeen
Point Zero Eight unless you want
to swap one Krasnow for another.
The fact is that I've learned I
can be one in Julie's dimension.
After all, their formula doesn't
work on me&mdash;but I can assure
you that it will work on you.</p>

<p>And that elephant story I told
on my last visit is, as I've indicated,
in the peanut category.
All Krasnow has is a country.
I'll have a whole world.</p>

<p>There's nothing like study under
a master, is there?</p>

<p>I should be back to Julie by
midnight if I start now.</p>
